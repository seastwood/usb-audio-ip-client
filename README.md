This is a Linux GUI for easier control of both USBIP and Pipewire services (specifically a microphone).

My Specific Use Case: 
I designed this because I want to use multiple USB devices and a microphone while game streaming with Moonlght/Sunshine on devices that don't allow device passthrough.
This allows me to easily use devices like a Steam Controller and a microphone attached to my Raspberry Pie Zero 2 W while streaming with Moonlight on my TV or Phone. This allows
me to remotely interact on Discord with a push to talk button on the controller.

How to use:
You must have ssh, Pipewire, and USBIP installed and enabled on the host device.
Pipewire and USBIP must also be installed and enabled on the client device.

Special thanks to the developers of USBIP and Pipewire for making this possible.
